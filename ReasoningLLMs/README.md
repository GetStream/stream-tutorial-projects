# Stream Reasoning LLMs Projects

This directory contains projects that demonstrate how to integrate reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with Stream's Chat and Video SDKs. These examples showcase advanced AI techniques for enhancing real-time communication.

## Overview

These projects explore the integration of reasoning-focused LLMs to create more intelligent and context-aware communication applications. The implementations demonstrate:

- Complex reasoning in conversational contexts
- Decision-making capabilities in chat applications
- Question answering with contextual awareness
- Multi-step reasoning for complex user queries
- Integration of LLMs with Stream's real-time communication platforms
