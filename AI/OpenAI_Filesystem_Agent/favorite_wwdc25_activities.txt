The following are my favorite WWDC25 activities.

- The main KeyNote Event and State of the Union at Apple Park.
- I love visiting San Francisco for after WWDC-related activities.
- I love attending local meetups in the Bay area.
- I always like to attend iOSDev Happy Hour in San Jose.
- After WWDC, the Core Coffee meetup in Cupertino is also great.
