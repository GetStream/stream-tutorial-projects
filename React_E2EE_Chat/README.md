# React End-to-End Encrypted Chat

This project demonstrates how to implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in a React chat application using Stream's Chat API.

## Overview

End-to-end encryption ensures that only the communicating users can read the messages and no intermediary, including Stream, can access the unencrypted content. This sample implementation shows:

- Setting up a secure React chat client
- Implementing client-side encryption/decryption
- Managing encryption keys
- Sending and receiving encrypted messages
- Maintaining Stream's real-time capabilities with encrypted content

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn
   ```
4. Update the project with your Stream API credentials
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn start
   ```

## Security Considerations

When implementing E2EE in production applications:
- Ensure proper key management practices
- Implement secure key exchange protocols
- Consider additional security measures like message expiration
- Test thoroughly for potential security vulnerabilities
